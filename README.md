    #### Description: The player's turn begins, and they are prompted to input their desired move in the format of coordinates. For example, if the player wants to place their letter in the top-right cell, they would enter "0, 2", where the first number represents the row (0-indexed) and the second number represents the column (0-indexed) on the coordinate plane.
    After the player makes their move, the system takes its turn. The algorithm is designed to make calculated moves that prioritize blocking the player from winning or creating its own winning opportunities. The system's move is automatically determined by the algorithm, ensuring a challenging gameplay experience.
    The game continues with alternating turns between the player and the system until one of two conditions is met: either there is a winner or the game's board is completely filled.
    A player wins when they have three of their letters (either "X" or "O") consecutively in a row, column, or diagonal on the board. If a winning condition is met, the game ends, and the winner is announced.
    If the game board becomes completely filled without a winner, it results in a draw, indicating that neither the player nor the system was able to achieve a winning position.
    Throughout the game, the board is continuously updated and printed to reflect the current state, allowing the player to visualize the progress and make strategic decisions accordingly.
    With the algorithm designed to ensure that the game's result can only be a draw or a loss for the human player, the challenge lies in finding the optimal moves to prevent the system from winning and potentially force a draw.
